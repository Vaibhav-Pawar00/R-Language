# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation and Behavioral Clustering using K-Means in R

---

## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation** using the **Mall Customers Dataset (Kaggle)**.  
It uses **K-Means Clustering** to group customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, revealing distinct shopping behaviors and purchase patterns.

The entire workflow — from data preprocessing to cluster visualization — is implemented in **R**, leveraging popular data science libraries such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `factoextra`.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer demographics and spending patterns.  
- Determine the **optimal number of clusters** using the Elbow and Silhouette methods.  
- Apply **K-Means Clustering** and visualize results using **PCA**.  
- Interpret each cluster to extract **business insights**.  
- (Optional) Build a **logistic regression model** to predict gender based on spending habits.

## 📂 Dataset

**Source:** [Mall Customers Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python-and-r)  
**File:** `Mall_Customers.csv`  

| Column Name       | Description                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| CustomerID        | Unique ID assigned to each customer |
| Gender            | Male/Female                     |
| Age               | Age of the customer             |
| Annual Income (k$)| Annual income in thousands      |
| Spending Score (1–100) | Spending behavior score assigned by mall |

## 🧠 Project Workflow

### 🔹 1. Data Preparation
- Load and clean the dataset  
- Handle missing values (if any)  
- Select numeric columns for clustering (`Annual Income`, `Spending Score`)

### 🔹 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of income and spending  
- Boxplots by gender and age groups  
- Correlation analysis between income and spending  

### 🔹 3. Finding Optimal Clusters
- Apply **Elbow Method** using `fviz_nbclust()`  
- Validate using **Silhouette Analysis**  

### 🔹 4. K-Means Clustering
- Train K-Means with optimal `k` (typically 5)  
- Assign cluster labels to each customer  
- Compare cluster centers  

### 🔹 5. Visualization
- Scatterplots of clusters  
- PCA-based visualization using `fviz_cluster()`  
- Distribution plots of income and spending per cluster

| 2 | Moderate Income, Moderate Spending | Average Customers |
| 3 | High Income, Low Spending | Potential Customers |
| 4 | Low Income, High Spending | Impulsive Buyers |
| 5 | Low Income, Low Spending | Budget Shoppers |
